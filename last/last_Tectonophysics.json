Paleomagnetic measurements on 361 samples produced paleo-inclination data that were used to estimate paleolatitude. Twenty five independent magnetic units give a paleocolatitude of 90.1\u00b0 \u00b14.4\u00b0 (2\u03c3 uncertainty), implying a paleolatitude exactly on the equator. Unit variance agrees with global paleosecular variation models, implying that these variations have been properly sampled and averaged. The paleolatitude implies northward drift of \u223c28\u00b0, which agrees with other Izu-Bonin forearc sites of similar age. A slight difference in northward drift with southern Philippine Sea plate sites is consistent with plate rotation.

Moreover, because the plate is largely submarine, few fully-oriented paleomagnetic data are available. International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 352 cored at four sites on the Izu-Bonin forearc, penetrating \u223c1170&nbsp;m of forearc igneous crust radiometrically dated at \u223c51&nbsp;Ma. Paleomagnetic measurements on 361 samples produced paleo-inclination data that were used to estimate paleolatitude. Twenty five independent magnetic units give a paleocolatitude of 90.1\u00b0 \u00b14.4\u00b0 (2\u03c3 uncertainty), implying a paleolatitude exactly on the equator. Unit variance agrees with global paleosecular variation models, implying that these variations have been properly sampled and averaged. The paleolatitude implies northward drift of \u223c28\u00b0, which agrees with other Izu-Bonin forearc sites of similar age. A slight difference in northward drift with southern Philippine Sea plate sites is consistent with plate rotation. Certain parts of the cored sections yield samples that were remagnetized to the present geocentric axial dipole inclination after \u223c30&nbsp;Ma, implying a tectonic event of unclear origin.</span><br /></p>"
