We modelled geotherms from the present-day conditions backward in time to 3.0 Ga at thermal equilibrium in the lithosphere by adjusting three dominant variables: (i) time-corrected crustal heat production; (ii) a secularly cooling mantle potential temperature (Tp) in the underlying convecting mantle; and, for illustrative purposes, (iii) variable depth of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) or variable heat flow at the LAB. Computed model geotherms were compared to DI PT data from the Kaapvaal craton, as well as PT conditions recorded in mantle xenoliths of variable age. It is demonstrated that equilibrium geotherms in the lithosphere cannot be reconciled with PT conditions recorded in Kaapvaal craton DI nor with those recorded in Proterozoic xenoliths if either the lithosphere has remained of constant thickness or held a constant basal heat flux since 3.0 Ga. Rather, provided that PT conditions recorded by DI from the Kaapvaal craton reflect equilibration along fossil ancient equilibrium geotherms, it is required that the early lithosphere was substantially thicker than what is preserved today.

The timescale over which the solid Earth - ice sheet system responds to changes in ice thickness and bedrock topography places a strong control on the spatiotemporal influence of this negative feedback mechanism. In this study, we assess the impact of solid-earth rheological structure on model projections of the retreat of Thwaites Glacier, West Antarctica, and the concomitant sea-level rise by coupling the dynamic ice sheet model MALI to a regional glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) model. We test the sensitivity of model projections of ice-sheet retreat and associated sea-level rise across a range of four different solid-earth rheologies, forced by standard ISMIP6 ocean and atmospheric datasets for the RCP8.5 climate scenario. These model parameters are applied to 500-year, coupled ice-sheet - GIA simulations. For the mantle viscosity best supported by observations, the negative GIA feedback leads to a reduction in mass loss that remains above 20% after about a hundred years. Mass-loss reduction peaks at 50% around 2300, which is when a control simulation without GIA experiences its maximum rate of retreat. For a weaker solid-earth rheology that is unlikely but compatible with observational uncertainty, mass loss reduction remains above 50% after 2150. At 2100, mass loss reduction is 10% for the best-fit rheology and 25% for the weakest rheology. At the same time, we estimate that water expulsion from the rebounding solid Earth beneath the ocean near Thwaites Glacier may increase sea-level rise by up to 20% at five centuries. Additionally, the reduction in ice-sheet retreat caused by GIA is substantially reduced under stronger climate forcings, suggesting that the stabilizing feedback of GIA will also be an indirect function of emissions scenario. We hypothesize that feedbacks between the solid Earth - ice sheet system are controlled by a competition between the spatial extent and timescale of bedrock uplift relative to the rate of grounded ice retreat away from the region of most rapid unloading. Although uncertainty in solid-earth rheology leads to large uncertainty in future sea-level rise contribution from Thwaites Glacier, under all plausible parameters the GIA effects are too large to be ignored for future projections of Thwaites Glacier of more than a century.</span><br /></p>",

Thermal history modelling, geomorphological analysis, stratigraphic analysis, and river profile analysis have all suggested the region experienced surface uplift during the late Cenozoic. This is in contrast with many low-temperature thermochronology studies, which consistently present Mesozoic dates and typically infer the landscape to be the remnant of a much older mountain belt that has been slowly exhumed following the end of rifting in the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic. Resolving a regional exhumation history of the Appalachians through traditional low-temperature thermochronology methods is difficult due to the spatial constraints of bedrock sampling, while traditional detrital river sampling has limitations underpinned by analytical issues and grain selection bias. We aim to resolve the exhumation histories of large areas across the Appalachians using detrital laser ablation apatite (U-Th-Sm)/He dating (LA-AHe). LA-AHe is a new dating approach that produces a high number of apatite (U-Th-Sm)/He ages from modern river sands to infer the low-temperature (70\u201340&nbsp;\u00b0C) exhumation history of the bedrock across a catchment. Supplementary apatite and zircon U-Pb dates were obtained to study sediment transport in each catchment and their respective bedrock geological histories. LA-AHe results show most dates to be Cretaceous (69%), with only a small Cenozoic fraction (6%), while thermo-kinematic modelling of data from four catchments can be explained by protracted Mesozoic-Cenozoic exhumation with rates \u223c31\u201320 m/Myr. The lack of Cenozoic dates does imply the magnitude of exhumation has not been significant enough to greatly affect the apatite (U-Th-Sm)/He system, though models incorporating enhanced late Cenozoic exhumation between 2.1\u20131.4 km are consistent with data from three catchments. These results have implications for the study of elevated topography across passive margins and ancient orogens and highlight how laser ablation apatite (U-Th-Sm)/He dating can be effectively used to study the change of landscapes over geological timescales.</span><br /></p>",

Thermal history modelling, geomorphological analysis, stratigraphic analysis, and river profile analysis have all suggested the region experienced surface uplift during the late Cenozoic. This is in contrast with many low-temperature thermochronology studies, which consistently present Mesozoic dates and typically infer the landscape to be the remnant of a much older mountain belt that has been slowly exhumed following the end of rifting in the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic.

These anomalies are interpreted as the result of thermal effects of large-scale thermal upwelling (primary plume) in the lower mantle or deep dehydration of fluid-rich subducting oceanic plates. We present the results of thermo-mechanical numerical modelling to investigate the dynamics of such small-scale thermal and chemical (hydrous) anomalies rising from the lower part of the Earth's upper mantle. Our objective is to determine the conditions that allow thermo-chemical secondary plumes of moderate size (initial radius of 50 km) to penetrate the continental lithosphere, as often detected in seismo-tomographic studies. To this end, we examine the effect of the following parameters: (1) the compositional deficit of the plume density due to the presence of water and hydrous silicate melts, (2) the width of the weak zone in the overlying lithosphere formed because of plume-induced magmatic weakening and/or previous tectonic events, and (3) a tectonic regime varied from neutral to extensional. In our models, secondary plumes of purely thermal origin do not penetrate the overlying plate, but flatten at its base, forming \u201cmushroom\u201d-shaped structures at the level of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary. On the contrary, plumes with enhanced density contrast due to a chemical (hydrous) component are shown to be able to pass upwards through the lithospheric mantle to shallow depths near the Moho when (1) the compositional density contrast is \u2265 100 kg m\u22123 and (2) the width of the lithospheric weakness zone above the plume is \u2265 100 km. An extensional tectonic regime facilitates plume penetration into the lithosphere but is not mandatory. Our findings can explain observations that have long remained enigmatic, such as the \u201carrow\u201d-shaped zone of low seismic velocities below the Tengchong volcano in south-western China and the columnar (\u201cfinger\u201d-shaped) anomaly within the lithospheric mantle discovered more than two decades ago beneath the Eifel volcanic fields in north-western Germany. It appears that a chemical component is a characteristic feature not only of conventional hydrous plumes located over presently downgoing oceanic slabs, but also of upper mantle plumes in other tectonic settings.</span><br /></p>",
