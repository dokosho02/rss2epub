Since 1960, several sediment budget records have been established for this region, estimated by different approaches, and averaged over different time scales. Here, we have compiled 196 records of sediment load, sediment yield, and erosion rate published between 1960 and 2022 for different catchments across the IGP. We categorised the data as long-term (multi-centennial to multi-millennial) and short-term (annual to multi-decadal) records, based on the timescale they are averaged upon. We find that there is a clear gradient of sediment yield across the IGP where long-term sediment yield decreases from \u223c5800&nbsp;t/yr/km2 (Sutlej basin) in the west to \u223c1200&nbsp;t/yr/km2 (Ganges basin) in the east and the short-term yield decreases from \u223c1800&nbsp;t/yr/km2 (Sutlej basin) in the west to \u223c100&nbsp;t/yr/km2 (Ganges basin) in the east. Our analysis shows that the driving factors of sediment generation and dispersion vary throughout the region and among the integration timescales. The region south of the Main Frontal Thrust, specifically the IGP, is highly populated and the short-term records suggest an anthropogenic bias. However, we show that only a low but measurable percentage of the annual sediment load is trapped by anthropogenic interventions, such as dams and barrages, when we compare the short- and long-term sediment loads. Among 172 sampled catchments, both short (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;87) and long-term (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;60) loads from basins with area &gt;100&nbsp;km2, show nearly log-linear correlation with their respective basin sizes. However, in case of the Ganga-Brahmaputra basin, the slope of the best fit line for the short-term loads is 30% lower compared to long-term loads. The short-term load estimations for the same basin size are consistently lower than the long-term loads. We attribute this discrepancy on the lag in response time of the vast IGP dispersal system. We note that the variability of long-term erosion rates from west to east correspond well (R2&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.77, n&nbsp;=&nbsp;6) with the variability of mean normalized channel steepness indices for all major catchments to the south of the Main Frontal Thrust region. To the north of the Main Frontal Thrust, the variation of long-term erosion rates correlates well with channel steepness within a single catchment, but not in a similar fashion across different catchments from west to east. We observe that the linear relationship between long-term erosion rate and channel steepness index for individual basins to the north of the MFT is influenced by the presence of high vegetation density; however, any correlation between long-term erosion rates with mean annual rainfall and vegetation cover is absent. Our analyses suggest that short-term records are more susceptible to vegetation cover changes in steep terrains, but landscape erosion rates at these timescales are also driven by various degrees of landscape steepness. We show that short-term records are influenced by transient sediment storages on the IGP that respond to past tectonic and climatic forcing. This underlines the importance of understanding transient sediment storages when interpreting short-term records in the context of recent climatic changes and anthropogenic impacts.</span><br /></p>",

The \u03b418O values of the lake sediments in the central and western Tibetan Plateau increased since the early Holocene, which agrees with the trend of \u03b418O in speleothem records from the plateau, as well as with the variations of monsoon precipitation reconstructions for the region. Overall, this evidence indicates the substantial influence of the monsoon in the abovementioned regions.

It has been suggested that the increased contribution from westerlies-derived moisture in the non-monsoon season, with depleted \u03b418O (e.g., from melting snow or frozen soil in spring), is responsible for such variations.

EAVP volcanic centres contain mantle-derived melts that show minor fractionation but have large ranges in major element concentrations. Current lava field and central volcano classifications of basaltic centres do not capture geochemical trends, and primitive melt compositions throughout the EAVP cannot be explained by partial melting of mantle peridotites alone. Based on a collated dataset of 3971 samples with chemical and spatial data, we classify its volcanism and identify mantle source assemblage compositions that give rise to its melts.We identify all late Mesozoic (\u223c110&nbsp;Ma) and all Cenozoic mafic volcanism in eastern Australia as the EAVP. Three volcanic regions are recognised within the EAVP: (1) The Northern Region in northern Queensland is comprised predominately of basalts. (2) The Central Region, which includes volcanism lying between the Northern and Southern Regions, is a combination of dominantly basaltic rocks with some felsic plugs and intrusions. Three age progressive tracks are recognised in this region with intermittent non-age-progressive volcanism. (3) The Southern Region comprises all Cenozoic volcanism from Tasmania and Bass Strait. Here, lavas outcrop on lithosphere &lt;60&nbsp;km thick and are similar in composition to the Northern Region, but with a large temporal range. Collectively these three regions are made up of 67 separate volcanic centres, with two dominant volcanic centre compositions, namely basalt and leucitite.Primitive melt compositions in the EAVP can be produced by melting mantle source assemblages consisting of various proportions of three \u2018end-members\u2019: (1) a mixed anhydrous peridotite-pyroxenite, (2) a hydrous (phlogopite- and/or amphibole-bearing) pyroxenite, and (3) a hydrous pyroxenite + accessory Ti-oxides \u00b1 apatite. Primitive melts were identified with a filter on whole rock oxides Mg#&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;58, FeOt&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;6&nbsp;wt%, CaO&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;5.5&nbsp;wt%, and MnO&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0.07&nbsp;wt%, which is based on experimental melt compositions from realistic source compositions and P-T conditions. We suggest that the majority, if not all, of mantle source assemblages that gave rise to the EAVP underwent some degree of mantle metasomatism; this produced the three source end members introduced above. The metasomatic agents were probably silicate and carbonatite melts related to past subduction events during the accretion of eastern Australia while attached to eastern Gondwana between the mid-Cambrian to the late Triassic. Basalt and leucitite centres can be separated by TiO2 and K2O concentrations. Basaltic centres represent melts from the least metasomatised mantle sources on younger and thinner lithosphere to the east, whereas leucititic centres erupted on older and thicker lithosphere to the west, are sourced from the most pervasively metasomatised mantle assemblages at greater depths (120-160&nbsp;km).Melts within the EAVP were generated at temperatures below those required to melt peridotite, as the solidi for metasomatised mantle assemblages are depressed by \u223c300&nbsp;\u00b0C compared to anhydrous peridotites. At these cooler temperatures, the melting process could be initiated by a slight increase above the ambient upper mantle temperature (\u223c1350&nbsp;\u00b0C); this is compatible with shear-driven upwelling and edge-driven convection rather than mantle plume activity as the melting mechanism for intraplate volcanism in eastern Australia. Lower solidus temperatures increase the probability for future eruptions occurring at volcanic centres considered dormant.</span><br /></p>",

This systematic-style review attempts to identify the evidence for: (1) historical trends in observed data and (2) changes in model-based projections for the future, in low river flow and hydrological drought indices in rivers of Central Europe. In the context of this review, focusing on directions rather than magnitude of historical and future changes, we were treating hydrological droughts and low flows as synonyms. To address these questions, we searched Web of Science and Scopus databases and screened 976 abstracts to identify 68 articles fulfilling all inclusion criteria from which metadata were extracted and analyzed. The results show that overall, trends detected in observation records have more frequently downward (i.e. meaning decreased low flows or increased drought hazard) than upward direction (53% vs. 11%). However, the frequency of evidence reporting decreases in future low flows is lower for future projections than for historical trends (43% vs. 53%), and even more convincingly, nearly three times more evidence items point out at upward trends in the future (31% vs. 11%).

Nevertheless, the question of when the Paleo-Asian Ocean finally closed has notoriously been enigmatic, especially due to the absence of large-scale investigations. The South Tianshan-Solonker Suture, is the largest and southernmost suture within the CAOB, and records the ultimate collision between the Tarim-North China cratons with the Siberia craton, and is commonly interpreted as marking the eventual closure of the Paleo-Asian Ocean. In this paper, we synthesize and evaluate relevant Chinese papers on the area, which are not readily available to an international audience, and extend this across the full length of the suture zone. Based on this review, we can divide the suture zone into four distinct segments, which are, from west to east: the South Tianshan Belt, the Beishan Belt, the Solonker Belt and the Yanji Belt. This enables us to provide a more systematic understanding of the nature and development of the South Tianshan-Solonker suture.Geochronological data from Paleozoic cover rocks and high-pressure metamorphic rocks show that during the late Carboniferous, the western section of the Paleo-Asian Ocean closed when the Tarim Craton moved northward to collide with the Kazakhstan-Yili Block, thus marking the initial development of the South Tianshan Belt. The Beishan Belt to the east formed when the Dunhuang-Alxa blocks were transported northward to collide with the Tuva-Mongolia Block, with the youngest zircon UPb data from ophiolites indicating that closure of the local Beishan Ocean was in the early-middle Permian, although its final closure may not have been until the early late Permian along the northern margin of the Alxa Block, thus making it slightly younger than the South Tianshan Belt. Further to the east, the available petrographic, geochronological and paleontological data from the Solonker Belt indicate that this belt was formed in the middle-late Permian, during which time bi-directional subduction occurred and the North China and Siberia cratons were amalgamated during an \u2018Appalachian-type\u2019 orogeny. Furthermore, we observe that a transition in polarity from northward to bi-directional subduction occurred along the boundary between the Beishan and Solonker belts, which may be related to the East Gobi Transform Fault. In contrast, under the influence of the westward subduction of the Paleo-Pacific Ocean, the Jiamusi-Khanka Block moved southwestward along the Yilan-Yitong Fault in the middle-late Triassic (230\u2013220&nbsp;Ma) to amalgamate with the North China Craton.The formation of the South Tianshan-Solonker Suture can be characterized by four distinct west-to-east accretion/collision events that lasted from the late Carboniferous to the late Permian. The South Tianshan Belt, the Beishan Belt and the Solonker Belt therefore demarcate, respectively, the amalgamation between the Tarim Craton and the Kazakhstan-Yili Block, the Dunhuang-Alxa Block and the Tuva-Mongolia Block, and the North China Craton with the Siberia Craton, representing the final closure of the Paleo-Asian Ocean. During the middle-late Triassic, the Yanji Belt in the far east was influenced by the Paleo-Pacific tectonic domain as a result of amalgamation between the Jiamusi-Khanka Block and the North China Craton.</span><br /></p>",
