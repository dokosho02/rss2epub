The timescale over which the solid Earth - ice sheet system responds to changes in ice thickness and bedrock topography places a strong control on the spatiotemporal influence of this negative feedback mechanism. In this study, we assess the impact of solid-earth rheological structure on model projections of the retreat of Thwaites Glacier, West Antarctica, and the concomitant sea-level rise by coupling the dynamic ice sheet model MALI to a regional glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) model. We test the sensitivity of model projections of ice-sheet retreat and associated sea-level rise across a range of four different solid-earth rheologies, forced by standard ISMIP6 ocean and atmospheric datasets for the RCP8.5 climate scenario. These model parameters are applied to 500-year, coupled ice-sheet - GIA simulations. For the mantle viscosity best supported by observations, the negative GIA feedback leads to a reduction in mass loss that remains above 20% after about a hundred years. Mass-loss reduction peaks at 50% around 2300, which is when a control simulation without GIA experiences its maximum rate of retreat. For a weaker solid-earth rheology that is unlikely but compatible with observational uncertainty, mass loss reduction remains above 50% after 2150. At 2100, mass loss reduction is 10% for the best-fit rheology and 25% for the weakest rheology. At the same time, we estimate that water expulsion from the rebounding solid Earth beneath the ocean near Thwaites Glacier may increase sea-level rise by up to 20% at five centuries. Additionally, the reduction in ice-sheet retreat caused by GIA is substantially reduced under stronger climate forcings, suggesting that the stabilizing feedback of GIA will also be an indirect function of emissions scenario. We hypothesize that feedbacks between the solid Earth - ice sheet system are controlled by a competition between the spatial extent and timescale of bedrock uplift relative to the rate of grounded ice retreat away from the region of most rapid unloading. Although uncertainty in solid-earth rheology leads to large uncertainty in future sea-level rise contribution from Thwaites Glacier, under all plausible parameters the GIA effects are too large to be ignored for future projections of Thwaites Glacier of more than a century.</span><br /></p>",

At the East Pacific Rise (EPR), 9\u00b050.3'N, time series data for a 25+ year period reveal a correlation between these variations and magmatic diking events. Heat input from dikes appears to cause phase separation within the rising fluids splitting them into low-salinity vapor and high-salinity brine phases. The intrusion of a new dike is therefore likely to result in a characteristic salinity signal, with early post-eruptive fluids showing vapor-influenced low salinity and later brine-influenced fluids showing high salinity values.We here use a 2-D multiphase hydrothermal flow model to relate these observations to processes and properties within the sub-seafloor such as permeability, porosity, background flow rates, and phase separation as well as segregation phenomena. We have grouped the time evolution of vent fluid salinity into four temporal stages and have identified how multiphase flow phenomena control vertical salt mass fluxes within each stage. Rock porosity and permeability as well as background temperature of the undisturbed hydrothermal system control the duration of the four stages and maximum venting salinity. Based on our results, we are able to reproduce the characteristics of time-series data from the EPR at 9\u00b050.3'N and infer the likely ranges of rock properties and the hydrothermal conditions within the oceanic crust beneath.</span><br /></p>",

At the East Pacific Rise (EPR), 9\u00b050.3'N, time series data for a 25+ year period reveal a correlation between these variations and magmatic diking events. Heat input from dikes appears to cause phase separation within the rising fluids splitting them into low-salinity vapor and high-salinity brine phases. The intrusion of a new dike is therefore likely to result in a characteristic salinity signal, with early post-eruptive fluids showing vapor-influenced low salinity and later brine-influenced fluids showing high salinity values.We here use a 2-D multiphase hydrothermal flow model to relate these observations to processes and properties within the sub-seafloor such as permeability, porosity, background flow rates, and phase separation as well as segregation phenomena. We have grouped the time evolution of vent fluid salinity into four temporal stages and have identified how multiphase flow phenomena control vertical salt mass fluxes within each stage. Rock porosity and permeability as well as background temperature of the undisturbed hydrothermal system control the duration of the four stages and maximum venting salinity. Based on our results, we are able to reproduce the characteristics of time-series data from the EPR at 9\u00b050.3'N and infer the likely ranges of rock properties and the hydrothermal conditions within the oceanic crust beneath.</span><br /></p>"
