The results of tribo-tests show that the antiwear characteristics are different when using FFO compared to using a single additive oil such as base oil +&nbsp;ZDDP. A two-phase temperature-dependent wear trend was found when FFO is used. Phase (I) is in the low-temperature range, where wear increases with increasing tribofilm thickness and temperature. Phase (II) is in the high-temperature range where the tribofilm thickness increases but wear decreases as the temperature increases. Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the tribofilm show that the most temperature-dependent compositions are phosphates and iron sulphides, where the signal intensity of phosphates increases, but that of sulphides decreases when the temperature increases. It indicates that the participation of detergent and ZDDP in the tribofilm formation increases at low and high temperatures, respectively. However, no signal shows the dispersant participating in the tribofilm formation. A hypothesis of mechanisms of reaction priority or enhanced competition among different additives at different temperatures is proposed from the iron loss perspective to explain the two-phase temperature-dependent wear mechanism.

The enhanced tribological properties at 800&nbsp;\u00b0C are attributed to the synergistic effect of suppressed oxide volatilization and rapid oxidation behavior ensuring continuous dense tribo-layer formation.</span><br /></p>"

Therefore, a TPU composite material reinforced by WS2 and UHMWPE was prepared. After friction and vibration tests, it was found that WS2 reduced the coefficient of friction of TPU matrix with its excellent lubricating properties, and after adding UHMWPE, the coefficient of friction continued to drop to 0.07 and became more stable during the whole friction process. The synergistic effect of WS2 and UHMWPE effectively reduced the friction and amplitude of the composite and made the composite present the best tribological and vibration-absorbing performance.

When 9&nbsp;wt% GNS/Ag hybrid was incorporated into fabric composites, the friction coefficient and wear rate of Fabric-9GNS/Ag decreased by 40&nbsp;% and 72&nbsp;% because of synergistic enhancement of GNS and Ag nanoparticles. The MD simulation demonstrated that GNS/Ag hybrid had a strong interaction with molecular chains of PTFE, Kevlar and phenolic resin.</span><br /></p>"

In the present work, the nanostructured (grain size \u02c2 100&nbsp;nm) BM and UBM sputtered Niobium-doped amorphous Carbon (Nb: a-Carbon) films' microstructural, mechanical, and tribological characteristics changes were thoroughly investigated and compared. From the XRD and Raman analysis outcomes both graphite-like Carbon (GLC) and Niobium carbide (NbC) phases were detected in the BM sputtered film. However, novel cubic and hexagonal crystalline Diamond (CD) phases were successfully constructed from the UBM sputtered films besides the GLC and NbC phases. Records displayed that the change over the cathode magnetic field configuration from BM to UBM is a responsible factor for the reduction of the surface roughness (from 32&nbsp;nm to 25&nbsp;nm) and increment of the crystallite size (from 14&nbsp;nm to 15.5&nbsp;nm), hardness (from 18&nbsp;GPa to 27&nbsp;GPa), and elastic modulus (from 210&nbsp;GPa to 425&nbsp;GPa) values. On the contrary, via changing BM to UBM sputtering the films' tribological properties were negatively affected, leading to the increase of the coefficient of friction (COF) from 0.09 to 0.11 and the wear rate (WR) from 5.25&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10\u22125 mm3/N.m to 9&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10\u22125 mm3/N.m. The achieved results confirmed that the UBM configuration could be selected as a critical facility over the MS system that gives enough energy to arrange Carbon species in the crystalline Diamond phase at a relatively low temperature. One step further, the Ar/CH4 ratio variation was assessed as an influential factor that leaves considerable changes over the UBM sputtered film characteristics.

In the present work, the nanostructured (grain size \u02c2 100&nbsp;nm) BM and UBM sputtered Niobium-doped amorphous Carbon (Nb: a-Carbon) films' microstructural, mechanical, and tribological characteristics changes were thoroughly investigated and compared. From the XRD and Raman analysis outcomes both graphite-like Carbon (GLC) and Niobium carbide (NbC) phases were detected in the BM sputtered film. However, novel cubic and hexagonal crystalline Diamond (CD) phases were successfully constructed from the UBM sputtered films besides the GLC and NbC phases. Records displayed that the change over the cathode magnetic field configuration from BM to UBM is a responsible factor for the reduction of the surface roughness (from 32&nbsp;nm to 25&nbsp;nm) and increment of the crystallite size (from 14&nbsp;nm to 15.5&nbsp;nm), hardness (from 18&nbsp;GPa to 27&nbsp;GPa), and elastic modulus (from 210&nbsp;GPa to 425&nbsp;GPa) values. On the contrary, via changing BM to UBM sputtering the films' tribological properties were negatively affected, leading to the increase of the coefficient of friction (COF) from 0.09 to 0.11 and the wear rate (WR) from 5.25&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10\u22125 mm3/N.m to 9&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10\u22125 mm3/N.m. The achieved results confirmed that the UBM configuration could be selected as a critical facility over the MS system that gives enough energy to arrange Carbon species in the crystalline Diamond phase at a relatively low temperature. One step further, the Ar/CH4 ratio variation was assessed as an influential factor that leaves considerable changes over the UBM sputtered film characteristics. The results indicated that by doubling the Ar/CH4 ratio, the nanocrystalline Diamond phases are still observable. However, this change led to the increase in surface roughness (from 25&nbsp;nm to 28&nbsp;nm) and crystallite sizes (NbC, from 15.5&nbsp;nm to 18.6&nbsp;nm, cubic Diamond, from 25.8&nbsp;nm to 36&nbsp;nm, and hexagonal Diamond from 18.9&nbsp;nm to 21.6&nbsp;nm).

The present graphite porous materials have random internal pore distribution, and it is difficult to precisely reconstruct their tiny pore structures and manage their permeability. In this work, a method of constructing porous structures based on triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) is proposed, and the effect law of wall thickness and curvature parameter C on the permeability of TPMS porous structures is investigated. Permeability isotropic structures with permeability of approximately 5e-14&nbsp;m2 to 2e-13&nbsp;m2 are obtained by structural parameters adjustment and composite units.

Long-term stable GO-FND nanofluids were prepared by a two-step method. The friction test was carried out by a UMT5 tribometer.

The potential influences on rotordynamic and leakage performance of inlet preswirl ratios ranging from \u22121\u20131 are considered in the traditional labyrinth seal (LS), diaphragm labyrinth seal (DLS) and hole diaphragm labyrinth seal (HDLS). The simulation results show that the inlet preswirl of the LS has little influence under low rotation speeds, while the negative influence on the higher rotation speed for the positive preswirl is clear. The maximum improvement of effective damping under the \u22121 preswirl ratio compared to zero preswirl conditions for LS, DLS and HDLS can reach 132.1%, 240.6% and 385.1%, respectively, when that of effective stiffness for DLS and HDLS can improve 14.8% and 90.1%, respectively, and that of leakage reduction for DLS and HDLS can reach 4.12% and 4.5%, respectively. Meanwhile, the average leakage under different conditions of HDLS can obtain 5.70% reduction than that of LS and 1.78% than DLS, which is better than another new seal, which was proposed by other scholars. Further discussions on detailed flow areas show that the existence of holes brings more energy dissipation for HDLS, which brings lower leakage among the three different seals. Comparing DLS and HDLS also shows a potential combination to obtain a new type of seal with higher stability for rotor-seal systems and lower leakage.</span><br /></p>",
