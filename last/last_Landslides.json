The simulated precipitation relied on RCM-GCM models\u2019 runs, from EURO-CORDEX, and a multimodel ensemble mean. The extreme precipitation assessment relied on the values associated to the highest percentiles, and to the values associated to the RTTs\u2019 percentiles.

Although many methods have been used for landslide monitoring in the past, the identification, measurement and categorization of landslide-induced relative surface displacements, its relevant relationship with relative slope and structural features, and forecasting remain elusive. The present work explores a holistic approach towards studying slow-moving landslides in and around the urban locales (Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Gangtok) of Darjeeling\u2013Sikkim Himalaya. In order to establish an effective relationship, 109 successive C-band Sentinel-1A dataset acquired from February 2017 to October 2020 has been analysed using PSInSAR to identify the potential landslide risk zone in the selected blocks. Results indicate nearly 10.63% (~\u200942km2) of the total Sikkim monitoring area (~\u2009395km2) is subjected to a 20-40&nbsp;mm/yr of mean annual displacement rate and thus considered to be under the expression of potential risk. The contextual relationship between slope instabilities and regional thrusts/faults is also established. The derived time series displacement estimates are further integrated with corresponding slope estimates derived from the ALOS PALSAR DEM to determine the nature of Line of Sight (LOS) displacement followed by its classification into different categories and are further used in forecasting using ARIMA (1,1,1; 2,1,1) model.

Although many methods have been used for landslide monitoring in the past, the identification, measurement and categorization of landslide-induced relative surface displacements, its relevant relationship with relative slope and structural features, and forecasting remain elusive. The present work explores a holistic approach towards studying slow-moving landslides in and around the urban locales (Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Gangtok) of Darjeeling\u2013Sikkim Himalaya. In order to establish an effective relationship, 109 successive C-band Sentinel-1A dataset acquired from February 2017 to October 2020 has been analysed using PSInSAR to identify the potential landslide risk zone in the selected blocks. Results indicate nearly 10.63% (~\u200942km2) of the total Sikkim monitoring area (~\u2009395km2) is subjected to a 20-40&nbsp;mm/yr of mean annual displacement rate and thus considered to be under the expression of potential risk. The contextual relationship between slope instabilities and regional thrusts/faults is also established. The derived time series displacement estimates are further integrated with corresponding slope estimates derived from the ALOS PALSAR DEM to determine the nature of Line of Sight (LOS) displacement followed by its classification into different categories and are further used in forecasting using ARIMA (1,1,1; 2,1,1) model.

In July 2021, prolonged low-intensity rain in Angla Mountain, another short-duration intensive rain in Purang County, initiated runoff-triggered debris flows. In this work, we are mainly concerned with the differences in the triggering rainfall condition and local landscape dissection with respect to the freeze\u2013thaw state. The results reveal that the low triggering rainfall of debris flows at Angla Mountain may attribute to the long freeze\u2013thaw duration. The high triggering rainfall of debris flows in Purang County may attribute to the high saturated hydraulic conductivity and short freeze\u2013thaw duration. Nevertheless, freeze\u2013thaw duration, together with the low saturated hydraulic conductivity, may result in heavy landscape dissection of Angla Mountain. The Melton\u2019s ruggedness number of catchments in the two areas is greater than some suggested criteria, indicating they are susceptible to debris flows. Debris flow deposits have low proportions of grain size fractions\u2009&lt;\u20090.1&nbsp;mm and higher fractions of 1\u201310&nbsp;mm in size. Field measurement of a slope debris flow found that the mean diameter decreases as the slope gradient decreases and channel geometry widens. Such changes in gradient and channel geometry may lead to a volumetric concentration decrease, and the deposits become finer. This work preliminarily contributes to know about the effect of a freeze\u2013thaw state on the triggering rainfall of debris flows and local landscape dissection in the continental climate region, Tibet Plateau, China.</span><br /></p>",

In July 2021, prolonged low-intensity rain in Angla Mountain, another short-duration intensive rain in Purang County, initiated runoff-triggered debris flows. In this work, we are mainly concerned with the differences in the triggering rainfall condition and local landscape dissection with respect to the freeze\u2013thaw state. The results reveal that the low triggering rainfall of debris flows at Angla Mountain may attribute to the long freeze\u2013thaw duration. The high triggering rainfall of debris flows in Purang County may attribute to the high saturated hydraulic conductivity and short freeze\u2013thaw duration. Nevertheless, freeze\u2013thaw duration, together with the low saturated hydraulic conductivity, may result in heavy landscape dissection of Angla Mountain. The Melton\u2019s ruggedness number of catchments in the two areas is greater than some suggested criteria, indicating they are susceptible to debris flows. Debris flow deposits have low proportions of grain size fractions\u2009&lt;\u20090.1&nbsp;mm and higher fractions of 1\u201310&nbsp;mm in size. Field measurement of a slope debris flow found that the mean diameter decreases as the slope gradient decreases and channel geometry widens. Such changes in gradient and channel geometry may lead to a volumetric concentration decrease, and the deposits become finer. This work preliminarily contributes to know about the effect of a freeze\u2013thaw state on the triggering rainfall of debris flows and local landscape dissection in the continental climate region, Tibet Plateau, China.</span><br /></p>"
