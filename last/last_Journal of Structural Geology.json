Models of crustal rheology depend on our knowledge of feldspar deformation mechanisms. To learn more about natural feldspar deformation, we conducted a multidisciplinary investigation of a brittle-ductile transition (BDT) hosted within a Cretaceous pluton in the Colorado River Extensional Corridor, southern Nevada. Here, a distinct BDT was observed at \u223c10&nbsp;km paleo-depth, where brittle faulting transitioned to discrete, localized ductile shearing. Field relationships confirm this BDT to have deformed and exhumed in the Miocene, temporally associated with the intrusion of two surrounding ca. 16 Ma plutons and subsequent footwall rotation in an east-directed normal-fault system. We established the overall structural framework, strain rates, and thermal histories through field traverses, aluminum-in-hornblende barometry to reconstruct paleo-depth, zircon (U\u2013Th)/He thermochronology (ZHe) to constrain temperature-time histories, and 1D thermal models to further resolve deformation temperatures. Localized shear zones within the BDT formed ca. 16.2\u201315.5&nbsp;Ma at temperatures of \u223c500\u2013600&nbsp;\u00b0C, which continued deforming as they cooled both conductively and advectively to \u223c200&nbsp;\u00b0C by ca. 14 Ma, as constrained by ZHe dates. Strain was concentrated in fine-grained (7\u201310&nbsp;\u03bcm) feldspar-rich ultramylonites that were interpreted to have primarily deformed via grain-size-sensitive diffusion creep. Grain-size reduction that allowed activation of diffusion creep likely resulted from brittle cataclasis, fluid-assisted fracturing and neocrystallization, and dislocation creep mechanisms, thus emphasizing the importance of these processes to localize deformation at relatively strong mid-crust conditions to facilitate the development of diffusion-creep shear zones. Grain-size piezometers suggest stresses of \u223c50&nbsp;MPa, which are significantly weaker than peak strength in quartz-rich BDTs that deform via dislocation creep. This integrated process allows relatively low viscosities (\u223c1018\u20131019&nbsp;Pa&nbsp;s) at lower crust temperatures and explains a coherent process of strain localization at near-BDT conditions in feldspar-dominated lithologies.

The magmatic flow and solid-state deformation were driven by gravity and facilitated by intrusion-induced thermal weakening. As the laccolith was exhumed, magmatic fluid overpressure and corresponding cyclical changes in the principal stress axis led to the development of alternating vertical and subhorizontal hydrofracturing within the brittle-ductile regime. Some of the subhorizontal hydrofractures were overprinted by top-to-the-SE brittle-ductile shear zones during the period from 125 to 123&nbsp;Ma, and subsequent top-to-the-SE brittle faults formed between 123 and 108&nbsp;Ma, indicating persistent subhorizontal shearing in the ductile, brittle-ductile, and brittle regimes. The structural evolution of the Congjia laccolith demonstrates that gravity-driven subhorizontal magmatic flow can trigger the development of subhorizontal shear zones in middle crust under a regional tensile setting.</span><br /></p>"

Type II olivine-rich veins were formed by brittle failure in a well-defined paleo-stress field and were not significantly deformed after their formation. Comparison of the principal paleo-stress orientation inferred from Type II veins with those formed at peak metamorphic conditions in the ultramafic rocks at Cerro del Almirez shows a relative switch in the orientation of the maximum and minimum principal paleo-stress axes. These relative changes can be attributed to the cyclic evolution of shear stress, fluid pressure and fault-fracture permeability allowing for stress reversal.</span><br /></p>",
